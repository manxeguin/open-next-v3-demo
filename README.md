# Turborepo starter

This is an official starter Turborepo.

## Goal of the Repo

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how we can leverage OpenNext v3 to build a custom Next.js app that is capable of injecting code at build time. For more details, please refer to this [article](https://manxeguin.github.io/blog/posts/nextjs-vertical-microfrontends).

## Using this example

1. Install deps


```sh
npm ci
```
2. Build the application:

```sh
npm run build-ap
```
3. run preview

```sh
npm run preview
```
4. open your browser at http://localhost:8080
